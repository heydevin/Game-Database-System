project summary

Our project is focused on building a game database system where users can create accounts, select characters with specific roles and skills, and engage in boss fights within a map, potentially including dungeons. The database, implemented using the Oracle database system, models entities such as user information, accounts, maps, and characters, including the skills and weapons along with their relationships. The system allows users to store and modify in-game data, while game developers can make updates to introduce new features, roles, and bosses.
