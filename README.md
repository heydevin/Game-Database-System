project summary

Our project is focused on building a game database system where users where user can create or log in to their own account in the system. On the main page, it displays the user's information and the language they chose to use in-game. The main page also displays buttons that are connected to other pages for users to manage their in-game data. The database, implemented using the Oracle database system, models entities such as user information, accounts, and characters, including the skills and weapons along with their relationships. The system allows users to store, modify and search in-game data, while game developers can make new updates to introduce new features.
